# FCC Daily Code Challenges 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to **daily FreeCodeCamp coding challenges**, mainly focused on JavaScript fundamentals.

The goal is not only to pass the tests, but to **understand the reasoning behind each solution** and build strong problem-solving habits over time.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

- Focus on fundamentals: loops, conditionals, arrays, accumulators  
- Emphasis on clarity and readable code  
- Solutions are written to learn, not to be clever  
- Some challenges may have multiple iterations as my understanding improves  

## 🤝 Tutor & Learning Companion

These solutions were developed with guidance from  
**FreeCodeCamp Pathlight Companion 4.3.1**, a tutoring-focused ChatGPT designed to:

- Encourage step-by-step reasoning  
- Avoid giving full solutions too early  
- Help debug logic instead of just fixing lines of code  
- Reinforce common FreeCodeCamp mental patterns

## 📌 Notes

This repository reflects my learning journey with FreeCodeCamp.  
Code may be refactored, simplified, or improved as I progress.
